# ðŸ˜· Covid Symptom Kiosk
The Symptom Kiosk is a easy to use, self-help kiosk designed to provide clear instructions. If they are clear to come into the building, they'll see a clear mark show up. If they aren't feeling well, or have a tempeture, they will get a sick mark; And be asked to return home.

## The Project
Please, note: This project is in no-way affiliated with any medical device company or government agency. This is purely a project created out of intrest and lack of things to do during, "lockdown". 
With that being said, I will not and can not be responsible for the accuracy of the device, and or code and software. If you use my project, you do so at your own risk. 

## The Software
The user-facing application was built using React.


## The Hardware
- We used an iPad Mini, with a Lightning to USB adapter to test the frontend application. 
- Note we reccomend using a Rasberry PI, with a touchscreen interface to provide the best hardware experience for your end-users.


## Contributing
As this is an open-source project, we ask for open contributions to the project. See something we messed up? Fix it. Want to add something new? Develop it. 
There are guidelines that are layed out within the CONTRIBUTING.md file, for doing a PR though!
